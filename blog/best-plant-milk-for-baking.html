            <h2>Substitution Ratios: How to Replace Dairy Milk</h2>
            
            <p>Good news: Most plant milks substitute 1:1 for dairy milk in baking. But here are the nuances:</p>
            
            <div class="pro-tip">
                <h3>Basic 1:1 Substitution (Works for Most Recipes):</h3>
                <p><strong>1 cup dairy milk = 1 cup plant milk</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="pro-tip">
                <h3>Making "Buttermilk" with Plant Milk:</h3>
                <p><strong>1 cup buttermilk = 1 cup plant milk + 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar</strong><br>Let it sit for 5 minutes to curdle before using. Works with any plant milk, but oat and soy work best.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>Tips for Success: Baking with Plant Milk</h2>

            <h3>1. Add Acid for Lift and Tenderness</h3>
            <p>Most plant milks are neutral pH, while dairy milk is slightly acidic. Add a splash of lemon juice or vinegar (1-2 teaspoons per cup) to activate baking soda and create tenderness.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Watch Your Sweetness</h3>
            <p>Oat milk and coconut milk are naturally sweeter than dairy. If using sweetened versions, reduce sugar in your recipe by 1-2 tablespoons per cup of milk.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Don't Overmix</h3>
            <p>Plant milk batters can become gummy if overmixed, especially with oat milk (natural starches). Mix just until combined.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Use Unsweetened for Savory Baking</h3>
            <p>Always use unsweetened plant milk for bread, pizza dough, savory muffins, and biscuits. Sweetened versions will taste weird.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Temperature Matters</h3>
            <p>Use room temperature plant milk in baking (like you would with dairy). Cold milk can seize up fats and affect texture.</p>
            
            <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Problem: Cookies spread too much</strong><br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Switch from oat milk to almond milk (less moisture). Or chill dough before baking.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Problem: Cake is too dense</strong><br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Add 1 teaspoon baking powder per cup of flour, or try soy milk for more protein structure.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Problem: Bread doesn't rise well</strong><br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Use soy milk (high protein helps gluten development). Or add 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Problem: Pancakes aren't fluffy</strong><br>
            <strong>Solution:</strong> Try soy milk (protein helps structure) or add an extra ½ teaspoon baking powder.</p>

            <p>Yes, soy milk is the best plant milk for bread baking. Its high protein content (7-9g per cup) helps with gluten development, creating sturdy, well-risen loaves with excellent structure. Use unsweetened soy milk for savory breads.</p>

            <h3>How do you make plant-based buttermilk?</h3>
            <p>To make plant-based buttermilk, combine 1 cup of plant milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar. Let it sit for 5 minutes to curdle before using. This works with any plant milk, but oat and soy milk produce the best results for baking.</p>
            
            <h2>Final Verdict: Which Plant Milk for Baking?</h2>
            
            <p>If you're building a plant-based pantry and can only keep one or two types of milk for baking, here's what we recommend:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Best All-Purpose Choice: Oat Milk (Unsweetened)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Works in 90% of recipes</li>
                <li>Affordable and widely available</li>
                <li>Creates moist, tender results</li>
                <li>Good for sweet and savory (if unsweetened)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Best Second Option: Soy Milk (Unsweetened)</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perfect for bread and savory baking</li>
                <li>High protein adds structure</li>
                <li>1:1 substitute for dairy in any recipe</li>
                <li>Neutral flavor works everywhere</li>
            </ul>
