            <p class="intro">Looking for the best plant milk for cooking savory dishes? Whether you're making mashed potatoes, creamy pasta sauce, soup, or gravy, choosing the right dairy-free milk can transform your cooking from good to restaurant-quality.</p>

            <p>The secret? Not all plant milks are created equal when it comes to cooking. Some curdle in heat, others taste too sweet, and some just don't create that creamy richness you're looking for. In this guide, we'll show you exactly which plant milk to use for every savory dish, plus cooking tips and troubleshooting advice.</p>

            <div class="quick-answer">
                <h2>🏆 Quick Answer: Best Plant Milk for Cooking</h2>
                <p><strong>Oat milk</strong> is the best all-around plant milk for savory cooking. It has a neutral flavor, creamy texture, and doesn't curdle easily in heat. It works beautifully in everything from mashed potatoes to creamy pasta sauces.</p>
                <p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Soy milk for high-heat cooking and recipes requiring extra body (higher protein content adds richness).</p>
            </div>

            <h2>🥇 #1: Oat Milk - The Creamy Champion</h2>
            
            <img src="/images/plant-milk-mashed-potatoes.jpg" alt="Creamy mashed potatoes being served with wooden spoon">
            
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Mashed potatoes, creamy soups, Alfredo sauce, mac & cheese, casseroles, creamy risotto</p>

            <h3>Why it wins:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neutral flavor:</strong> Won't add sweetness or compete with savory ingredients</li>
                <li><strong>Naturally creamy:</strong> Natural starches create rich, velvety texture</li>
                <li><strong>Heat stable:</strong> Doesn't curdle when simmered or heated</li>
                <li><strong>Good body:</strong> Similar thickness to whole milk</li>
                <li><strong>Versatile:</strong> Works in almost any savory recipe calling for milk or cream</li>
                <li><strong>Affordable:</strong> Usually cheaper than nut milks</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Works great in:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ultra-creamy mashed potatoes</li>
                <li>Potato soup and corn chowder</li>
                <li>Alfredo and carbonara sauces</li>
                <li>Mac and cheese</li>
                <li>Creamy mushroom risotto</li>
                <li>Casseroles and gratins</li>
                <li>Cream-based pasta sauces</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="pro-tip">
                💡 <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always use unsweetened oat milk for savory cooking. Sweetened versions will taste odd in mashed potatoes and sauces. Look for "barista" or "full fat" versions for the creamiest results.

            <h2>🥉 #3: Cashew Milk - The Luxury Option</h2>
            
            <img src="/images/plant-milk-creamy-soup.jpg" alt="Creamy vegetable soup in bowl with garnish">

            <h3>Why it works:</h3>

                <li><strong>Rich and silky:</strong> Closest to heavy cream in texture</li>

                <li><strong>Natural thickness:</strong> No need for thickeners</li>
                <li><strong>Gorgeous color:</strong> Creates that creamy white/beige look</li>

            <h2>Other Plant Milks for Cooking: When to Use (or Avoid) Them</h2>

            <h3>Coconut Milk 🥥</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Thai curries, Indian dishes, Southeast Asian soups</p>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Authentic flavor for Asian cuisine, very creamy, heat stable</p>
            <p><strong>Avoid for:</strong> Mashed potatoes, Italian pasta, anything where coconut flavor would be weird</p>
            <p><em>Note: Use canned "coconut milk" for cooking, not the carton "coconut milk beverage" which is too thin.</em></p>

            <h3>Almond Milk 🌰</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Lightening up soups, recipes where milk is just for moisture</p>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Very neutral, won't add calories or change flavor much</p>
            <p><strong>Avoid for:</strong> Creamy dishes - it's too thin and watery. Will make sad mashed potatoes.</p>

            <h3>Rice Milk 🍚</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> People with nut and soy allergies</p>
            <p><strong>Why:</strong> Hypoallergenic, neutral flavor, affordable</p>
            <p><strong>Avoid for:</strong> Anything creamy - it's the thinnest plant milk. Better as a last resort than a first choice.</p>

            <h3>Hemp Milk 🌿</h3>
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Honestly? Not much for cooking.</p>
            <p><strong>Why to avoid:</strong> Strong, grassy flavor that overpowers most savory dishes. Save it for smoothies.</p>

            <h2>Substitution Guide: Replacing Dairy in Recipes</h2>

            <h3>Replacing Regular Milk (1:1 ratio)</h3>
            <p><strong>1 cup dairy milk = 1 cup plant milk</strong></p>
            <p>Use: Oat milk or soy milk (unsweetened)</p>

            <h3>Replacing Heavy Cream</h3>
            <p><strong>1 cup heavy cream = 1 cup cashew milk OR ¾ cup oat milk + ¼ cup plant-based butter</strong></p>
            <p>For extra richness, use full-fat coconut milk from a can</p>

            <h3>Replacing Half-and-Half</h3>
            <p><strong>1 cup half-and-half = ½ cup oat milk + ½ cup cashew milk</strong></p>
            <p>Or use oat milk "barista blend" straight (it's thicker)</p>

            <h3>Replacing Buttermilk</h3>
            <p><strong>1 cup buttermilk = 1 cup plant milk + 1 tablespoon lemon juice or vinegar</strong></p>
            <p>Let it sit for 5 minutes to curdle. Works with any plant milk.</p>

            <h2>Cooking Tips: Getting Perfect Results Every Time</h2>

            <h3>1. Always Use Unsweetened for Savory Dishes</h3>
            <p>This is rule #1. Sweetened plant milk in mashed potatoes or pasta sauce tastes bizarre. Check the label - you want 0g sugar (or close to it).</p>

            <h3>2. Don't Boil Plant Milk Directly</h3>
            <p>Gentle heat is your friend. Add plant milk to hot dishes after removing from high heat, or simmer on low. Boiling can cause separation or curdling (especially with soy milk in acidic sauces).</p>

            <h3>3. Add Plant Milk Gradually to Hot Dishes</h3>
            <p>When making gravy or sauce, add plant milk slowly while whisking constantly. This prevents lumps and temperature shock that can cause curdling.</p>

            <h3>4. Thicken Sauces Before Adding Plant Milk</h3>
            <p>For gravies and sauces, make your roux (flour + fat) first, then gradually whisk in plant milk. The starch helps stabilize the milk and prevents separation.</p>

            <h3>5. Use Full-Fat Versions When Possible</h3>
            <p>Light or low-fat plant milks are too thin for most cooking. Look for "original," "full-fat," or "barista" versions for the best texture.</p>

            <h3>6. Season Generously</h3>
            <p>Plant milks are slightly less flavorful than dairy. Be generous with salt, pepper, garlic, herbs, and other seasonings to compensate.</p>

            <h3>7. Let Plant Milk Come to Room Temperature</h3>
            <p>Cold plant milk can cause fats to seize or create uneven texture. Take it out of the fridge 15-20 minutes before cooking.</p>

            <h2>Troubleshooting Common Cooking Problems</h2>

            <h3>Problem: Plant milk curdled in my sauce</h3>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You likely added it to something too hot or too acidic (like tomato sauce). Next time: (1) Remove from heat before adding milk, (2) Temper the milk by slowly adding hot liquid to it first, or (3) Use oat milk which is more stable than soy.</p>

            <h3>Problem: My mashed potatoes are watery</h3>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You used a thin plant milk (like almond). Switch to oat milk or cashew milk. Also, heat the plant milk before adding to potatoes, and use less than you think you need.</p>

            <h3>Problem: Gravy is lumpy</h3>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Add plant milk more gradually while whisking constantly. If lumps form, blend with an immersion blender or push through a fine-mesh strainer.</p>

            <h3>Problem: Sauce is too thin</h3>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Either use a thicker plant milk (cashew or barista oat), or add a cornstarch slurry (1 tablespoon cornstarch + 2 tablespoons cold water) and simmer until thickened.</p>

            <h3>Problem: Soup tastes "off" or too sweet</h3>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> You probably used sweetened plant milk. Always check labels. Fix it by adding more salt, acid (lemon juice), or savory seasonings to balance the sweetness.</p>

            <h2>Recipe Ideas: What to Make with Plant Milk</h2>

            <h3>Ultra-Creamy Mashed Potatoes</h3>
            <p>Use oat milk + vegan butter. Heat the oat milk before adding. Mash until smooth and season generously. Secret: add roasted garlic for extra flavor.</p>

            <h3>Perfect Mac & Cheese Sauce</h3>
            <p>Make a roux with vegan butter and flour, gradually whisk in oat milk, add nutritional yeast and your favorite vegan cheese. Creamier than dairy mac & cheese!</p>

            <h3>Restaurant-Quality Alfredo</h3>
            <p>Use cashew milk for ultimate creaminess. Sauté garlic in olive oil, add cashew milk and vegan parmesan, season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Toss with pasta.</p>

            <h3>Creamy Tomato Soup</h3>
            <p>Roast tomatoes with garlic and onion, blend until smooth, add oat milk for creaminess. The oat milk balances the acidity beautifully.</p>

            <h3>Smooth Country Gravy</h3>
            <p>Make a blonde roux, gradually whisk in soy milk, season with sage, thyme, salt, and plenty of black pepper. Perfect over biscuits.</p>

            <h2>Final Verdict: Which Plant Milk for Cooking?</h2>

            <p>If you're building a plant-based kitchen and can only keep one or two plant milks for cooking, here's what we recommend:</p>
