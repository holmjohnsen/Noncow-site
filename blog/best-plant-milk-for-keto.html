            <h2>Understanding Carbs in Plant Milk</h2>
            
            <p>When following a ketogenic diet, you're typically aiming to stay under 20-50g of net carbs per day. Since most people drink 1-2 cups of milk daily (in coffee, cereal, smoothies), choosing the right plant milk is crucial.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Net carbs</strong> are what matter for keto - that's total carbohydrates minus fiber. Most plant milks contain minimal fiber, so you're mainly looking at total carbs.</p>
            
            <h2>Complete Keto Plant Milk Breakdown</h2>
            
            <h3>ü•á Almond Milk (Best Overall for Keto)</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Net carbs per cup:</strong> 1-2g (unsweetened)</p>
            
            <p>Almond milk is the gold standard for keto dieters. It's naturally low in carbs, widely available, and versatile enough for any use. The unsweetened versions from brands like Silk, Almond Breeze, and Califia Farms typically contain just 1g of net carbs per cup.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Coffee, smoothies, cereal, baking</p>
            <p><strong>Taste:</strong> Light, slightly nutty, neutral enough for most recipes</p>
            <p><strong>Texture:</strong> Thin to medium, depending on brand</p>
            
            <h3>ü•• Coconut Milk Beverage (Runner-Up)</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Net carbs per cup:</strong> 1-2g (unsweetened)</p>
            
            <p>Don't confuse this with canned coconut milk (which is much higher in fat and calories). Coconut milk beverage - the kind in cartons - is incredibly keto-friendly with minimal carbs and a subtle tropical flavor.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Coffee, smoothies, curries, drinking straight</p>
            <p><strong>Taste:</strong> Mild coconut flavor, naturally sweet</p>
            <p><strong>Texture:</strong> Creamy and smooth</p>
            
            <h3>ü•ú Cashew Milk (Creamiest Option)</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Net carbs per cup:</strong> 2g (unsweetened)</p>
            
            <p>Cashew milk is slightly higher in carbs than almond or coconut, but still well within keto limits. What you get in return is an incredibly creamy texture that's perfect for coffee drinks and desserts.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Coffee, lattes, desserts, cream sauces</p>
            <p><strong>Taste:</strong> Rich, slightly sweet, very creamy</p>
            <p><strong>Texture:</strong> Thick and velvety</p>
            
            <h3>üå∞ Macadamia Milk (Premium Choice)</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Net carbs per cup:</strong> 1g (unsweetened)</p>
            
            <p>Macadamia milk is a newer player in the plant milk game, but it's exceptional for keto. Super low carb, high in healthy fats, and deliciously creamy. The downside? It's pricier and harder to find than other options.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Coffee, drinking straight, special recipes</p>
            <p><strong>Taste:</strong> Buttery, rich, slightly sweet</p>
            <p><strong>Texture:</strong> Luxuriously creamy</p>
            
            <h2>Plant Milks to AVOID on Keto</h2>
            
            <h3>‚ùå Oat Milk</h3>
            <p><strong>Net carbs per cup:</strong> 16-19g</p>
            <p>Oat milk is delicious, but it's a carb bomb. Even unsweetened versions contain too many carbs for most keto diets. Save this one for cheat days.</p>
            
            <h3>‚ùå Rice Milk</h3>
            <p><strong>Net carbs per cup:</strong> 22-27g</p>
            <p>Rice milk is essentially liquid carbs. Definitely skip this on keto.</p>
            
            <h3>‚ùå Soy Milk (Controversial)</h3>
            <p><strong>Net carbs per cup:</strong> 3-4g (unsweetened)</p>
            <p>Soy milk sits in a gray area. While unsweetened versions have manageable carbs for keto (3-4g), they're higher than almond or coconut. Some people can fit it into their macros, others prefer to avoid it. Plus, there are debates about soy and hormones, though research is mixed.</p>
            
            <h2>How to Choose the Best Keto Plant Milk</h2>
            
            <p>When shopping for keto-friendly plant milk, follow these guidelines:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Always choose unsweetened</strong> - This is non-negotiable. Sweetened versions add 10-15g of carbs.</li>
                <li><strong>Check the nutrition label</strong> - Aim for 2g or less net carbs per cup.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch for hidden sugars</strong> - Some brands add thickeners or flavors that increase carb counts.</li>
                <li><strong>Consider texture needs</strong> - Almond milk is thinner, cashew and coconut are creamier.</li>
                <li><strong>Buy in bulk if you find a winner</strong> - Most plant milks last 7-10 days after opening.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Using Plant Milk on Keto</h2>
            
            <h3>In Coffee</h3>
            <p>Almond, coconut, and cashew milk all work great in coffee. For the creamiest result, try cashew or use a barista blend almond milk (designed to froth better).</p>
            
            <h3>In Smoothies</h3>
            <p>Coconut milk adds richness and tropical flavor to keto smoothies. Almond milk is more neutral if you want other flavors to shine.</p>
            
            <h3>In Cooking</h3>
            <p>Unsweetened almond milk is the most versatile for savory dishes since it has the most neutral flavor. Coconut milk works well in curries and Asian-inspired recipes.</p>
            
            <h3>In Baking</h3>
            <p>For keto baking, almond milk or cashew milk work best as dairy milk replacements. They won't affect the carb count significantly and provide good texture.</p>
            
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>Can I drink plant milk every day on keto?</h3>
            <p>Yes, as long as you choose unsweetened, low-carb options like almond or coconut milk. One to two cups per day easily fits within keto macros.</p>
            
            <h3>Is homemade plant milk better for keto?</h3>
            <p>Homemade almond or coconut milk can be slightly lower in carbs since you control exactly what goes in. However, store-bought unsweetened versions are already very keto-friendly and much more convenient.</p>
            
            <h3>Which plant milk has the most fat for keto?</h3>
            <p>Canned coconut milk (the full-fat kind) has the most fat, but it's not typically used as a beverage. Among drinkable plant milks, coconut and macadamia milk contain the most healthy fats.</p>
            
            <h3>Does plant milk break a fast?</h3>
            <p>Technically yes, even unsweetened plant milk contains calories that will break a true fast. If you're doing intermittent fasting, save your plant milk for your eating window.</p>
            
            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            
            <p>For most people on keto, <strong>unsweetened almond milk</strong> is the best all-around choice. It's low in carbs (1-2g per cup), widely available, affordable, and works in virtually any recipe. Coconut milk is a close second, especially if you enjoy the flavor.</p>
            
            <p>Avoid oat milk and rice milk completely - they're carb bombs that will kick you out of ketosis. And always, always choose unsweetened versions.</p>
