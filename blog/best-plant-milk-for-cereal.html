            <h2>💡 Pro Tips for Perfect Cereal</h2>

            <h3>Temperature Matters</h3>
            <p>Cold plant milk tastes better on cereal than room temperature. Keep your plant milk well-chilled for the most refreshing breakfast.</p>

            <h3>Pour Strategically</h3>
            <p>Pour plant milk gradually rather than flooding your bowl all at once. This helps you control how soggy your cereal gets and prevents waste.</p>

            <h3>Mix It Up</h3>
            <p>Try combining two plant milks for a custom blend - like half oat milk (for creaminess) and half almond milk (for crunch preservation).</p>

            <h3>Consider Your Cereal Type</h3>
            <p>Dense cereals like granola pair best with creamy oat or pea milk, while light puffed cereals shine with thinner almond milk.</p>

            <h2>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>What is the best plant milk for cereal?</h3>
            <p>Oat milk is the best plant milk for cereal. It has a creamy texture and mild sweetness that works with all cereals - from granola to cornflakes. Oat milk stays smooth without separating and complements cereal flavors without overpowering them.</p>

            <h3>Which plant milk keeps cereal crunchy the longest?</h3>
            <p>Almond milk keeps cereal crunchy the longest because of its thin, watery texture. The lighter consistency doesn't saturate cereal flakes as quickly as thicker plant milks like oat or soy milk.</p>

            <h3>What plant milk has the most protein for cereal?</h3>
            <p>Soy milk has the most protein for cereal with 7-9 grams per cup. Pea milk is a close second with about 8 grams per cup. Both provide significantly more protein than almond milk (1g) or oat milk (3g).</p>

            <h3>Can kids have plant milk on cereal?</h3>
            <p>Yes, kids can have fortified plant milk on cereal. Look for plant milks fortified with calcium, vitamin D, and B12 to match dairy milk's nutrition. Soy milk and pea milk offer the most protein for growing kids.</p>

            <h3>Does oat milk make cereal soggy?</h3>
            <p>Oat milk can make cereal slightly soggier than almond milk due to its thicker consistency, but most people find the creamy texture worth it. If you prefer maximum crunch, use almond milk or eat cereal quickly after adding oat milk.</p>

            <h3>What's the healthiest plant milk for breakfast cereal?</h3>
            <p>Fortified soy milk is the healthiest plant milk for cereal, offering complete protein (all 9 essential amino acids), calcium, vitamin D, and B12. Choose unsweetened versions to avoid added sugars, especially if eating sweetened cereal.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>If you only keep one plant milk for cereal, make it <strong>unsweetened oat milk</strong> — it's creamy, lightly sweet, and works across every breakfast type. For the crunchiest flakes, almond milk wins. And if protein is your priority, soy or pea milk delivers extra nutrition without compromising taste.</p>
